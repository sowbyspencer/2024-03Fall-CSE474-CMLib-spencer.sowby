## 1. Purpose and scope

- The SQAP contains updates to section 1 in accordance with guidance given in C.3.1 in IEEE 730-2014:

  > “This section of the SQAP identifies and describes the purpose and scope of the SQAP for the specific project. Refer to 5.1 of this standard for a description of the purpose of SQA. Table C.3 shows questions and suggested inputs related to Purpose and Scope to consider asking during the Project Planning Phase.” [1] C.3.1 IEEE

- Section 1 references the Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
- Section 1 references the contract
- Section 1 clearly identifies the scope of the project (what are we doing/building and why)
- Section 1 is written from the perspective of Quality Management and clearly identifies the purpose of the document with regard to Quality Assurance

## 2. Definitions and acronyms

- The SQAP contains updates to section 2 in accordance with guidance given in C.3.2 in IEEE 730-2014 and the CSE474 instructions:

  > “This section of the SQAP defines all relevant terms and acronyms used in the SQAP. If it is known, definitions include a source.” [1] C.3.2 IEEE

- Section 2 contains at least one term or acronym and its definition
- Section 2 contains at least two terms or acronyms and their definitions
- Section 2 contains at least three terms or acronyms and their definitions

  > This section of the SQAP identifies all applicable standards, industry-specific regulations and compliance documents, documents referenced by the SQAP, and any relevant supporting documents. Supporting documents may include applicable professional, industry, government, corporate, organizational, and project-specific references. Table C.4 shows questions and suggested inputs related to Reference Documents to consider asking during the Project Planning Phase. [1] C.3.3 IEEE

- Section 3 contains a reference to the contract (doesn't need to link to anything)
- Section 3 contains references with active links to any other applicable documentation identified at this stage of SQAP development
